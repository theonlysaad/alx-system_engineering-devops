Introduction:
In this blog post, we will embark on a journey to explore the intricate steps that occur when you type "https://www.google.com" into your browser and press Enter.
1. DNS Request:
The journey begins with a Domain Name System (DNS) request. When you type the URL, your browser needs to find the corresponding IP address of the server hosting www.google.com. The DNS server translates the human-readable domain name into a machine-readable IP address, allowing your browser to locate the server on the internet.

2. TCP/IP:
Once the browser has the IP address, it establishes a connection using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). TCP ensures reliable data transmission by breaking the information into packets and verifying their successful delivery. IP, on the other hand, handles the routing of these packets across the internet to reach the destination server.

3. Firewall:
Before entering the server, the packets may encounter a firewall. Firewalls act as a barrier, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules. They protect the server from unauthorized access and potential security threats.

4. HTTPS/SSL:
Security is paramount, especially when transmitting sensitive data. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) encrypts the communication between the browser and the server, ensuring that the data remains confidential. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or its successor, Transport Layer Security (TLS), is responsible for this encryption, safeguarding the information from malicious actors.

5. Load-Balancer:
Large-scale websites like Google often employ load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers. This ensures optimal resource utilization and prevents any single server from becoming a bottleneck. Load balancers contribute to enhanced performance, availability, and scalability of the web application.

6. Web Server:
The load balancer directs the request to one of the web servers hosting the Google website. Web servers, such as Apache or Nginx, handle the initial processing of the request. They retrieve static content, like HTML and CSS files, and forward dynamic requests to the application server.

7. Application Server:
For dynamic content generation or processing, the request is handed over to the application server. This is where server-side scripts and business logic are executed. In Google's case, this step could involve running complex algorithms for search queries or handling user authentication.

8. Database:
When the application server needs to fetch or update data, it interacts with the database. In Google's context, this could involve retrieving search results or user preferences from a massive distributed database. Databases, such as MySQL or
